                <p style={{paddingTop: '50px'}}>The No Room For Racism Action Plan that was launched by the Premier League in February is underpinned by the following six commitments:</p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>Executive pathways</h2>
                <p>
                    These targets for the Premier League organisation have been set following research and analysis into national and regional <br></br>
                    representation, projected staff turnover and workforce growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They represent our commitment to treating all staff and potential candidates fairly, regardless of gender or ethnicity, and our belief <br></br>
                    that a more diverse workforce drives business performance.
                </p>
                <p>The current Premier League workforce is 37 per cent female with 12 per cent from a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Supporting initiatives and programmes:</p>
                <p>
                    - The launch of a central jobs board in collaboration with football stakeholders to provide transparency on roles available and remove <br></br>
                    barriers for candidates of all backgrounds looking to work in football.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Creation of an engaged pool of potential candidates who will receive information about opportunities for roles or career <br></br>
                    development.
                </p>
                <p>- Focused work all football stakeholders and other partners to increase the range of apprenticeships and placements across football.</p>
                <br></br>

                <h2>Coaching pathways</h2>
                <p>Supporting initiatives and programmes:</p>
                <p>- Agreement from football stakeholders to set an integrated diversity target for all coach development programmes and licensed <br></br> courses.</p>
                <p>
                    - Investment in positive action programmes specifically targeting coaches from underrepresented groups including the already <br></br>
                    launched Professional Player to Coach Scheme (in partnership with the PFA and EFL) <br></br>
                    and Premier League Coach Inclusion and Diversity Scheme.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Facilitate the sharing of the details of those coaches from a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background who have the UEFA A Licence <br></br>
                    or above (including the UEFA Pro Licence) who wish to have their details shared with Clubs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Premier League commitment to work with other football stakeholders to develop a coordinated coach and manager development <br></br>
                    strategy. This will have a specific focus on directly addressing the lack of first-team managers/head coaches who are from Black, <br></br>
                    Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds. The plan is in progress and a pilot development programme will launch later this year including <br></br>
                    places ringfenced for coaches of Black, Asian and minority ethnic background. Further details will be officially announced later in 2021.

                <p>
                    - Completion of a football workforce analysis in collaboration with football stakeholders to understand the demographics of all <br></br>

                    - Completion of a Youth Development review of Academy player pathways and their outcomes with a specific focus on inclusion.<br></br>
                    The review will use data and personal experiences to identify any areas where action can be taken to widen access, enabling progression<br></br> 
                    of the best talent and improving career outcomes as players or outside football.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Expansion of the existing Academy Parentsâ€™ Survey to better understand the experiences of players from a Black, Asian or minority<br></br>
                    ethnic background.
                </p>

                    <br></br>
                    - Continued provision of an online abuse reporting system to support players, managers and their families who have been victims of discriminatory <br></br>
